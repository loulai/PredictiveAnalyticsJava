MIAMI Tropical Storm Irene keeps getting stronger today and forecasters say it could reach hurricane strength as it approaches the East Coast.
Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Miami say Irene's threat to land is still uncertain.

Over the next five days, Irene could come near the U-S coastline somewhere from North Carolina to Massachusetts, but could also curve out to sea.

Normally, there are only two named storms by this time in the Atlantic hurricane season. Irene became the earliest ninth named storm in the season, when it developed Sunday.

It weakened into a tropical depression Monday, but regained tropical storm strength Wednesday.
