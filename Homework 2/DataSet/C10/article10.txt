MIAMI -- A renewed Tropical Storm Irene was gradually intensifying Thursday as it moved closer to the East Coast, forecasters said.

Irene could become a hurricane by Friday, and it was expected to continue over the next five days toward the coast somewhere from South Carolina to New Jersey, according to forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
	

"A possible U.S. landfall by (Tuesday) cannot be ruled out at this time," hurricane specialist Stacy Stewart said.

Irene had top sustained winds near 50 mph and was expected to strengthen as it moves over warm waters. Hurricanes have sustained winds of at least 74 mph.

At 11 p.m. EDT, Irene was centered about 410 miles south of Bermuda. It was moving west-northwest near 15 mph and was expected to slow down, forecasters said.

Irene broke records Sunday when it became the earliest ninth named storm in the Atlantic hurricane season, which began June 1 and ends Nov. 30. Typically, there are only two named storms by this time in the season.

Irene weakened into a tropical depression Monday, but regained tropical storm strength Wednesday.
