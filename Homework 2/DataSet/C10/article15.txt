MIAMI (AP) - Tropical depression Irene was getting better organized Tuesday in the central Atlantic, forecasters said, but still posed no immediate threat to land.

Irene had top sustained winds of 35 mph, just below the 39 mph threshold to become a tropical storm. Forecasters said it was possible for Irene to strengthen into a tropical storm by Wednesday.

At 11 p.m. EDT, Irene was about 890 miles southeast of Bermuda, moving west near 10 mph, forecasters said.

Irene became a tropical storm Sunday, breaking records as the earliest ninth named storm in the Atlantic hurricane season, which began June 1 and ends Nov. 30. Normally, there are only two named storms by this time in the season, hurricane specialist James Franklin said.

It weakened into a tropical depression Monday.
