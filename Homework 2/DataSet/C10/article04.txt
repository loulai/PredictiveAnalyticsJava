Tropical storm Irene kept getting stronger Friday and could reach hurricane strength as it approaches the U.S. East Coast, forecasters said.

Irene's threat to land was still uncertain, according to forecasters at the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami. A five-day forecast indicated that Irene could near the U.S. coastline somewhere from North Carolina to Massachusetts, but could also curve out to sea.

At 11 a.m. EDT, Irene's top sustained winds had increased to about 105 kilometres an hour – hurricanes have sustained winds of at least 119 km/h. A hurricane hunter aircraft was scheduled to fly into the storm later Friday to get a better reading on its strength.

Irene's centre was located about 500 kilometres south-southwest of Bermuda and about 1,100 kilometres southeast of Cape Hatteras, N.C. It was moving northwest near 21 km/h, although it was expected to slow down, forecasters said.

Normally, there are only two named storms by this time in the Atlantic hurricane season, which began June 1 and ends Nov. 30. Irene became the earliest ninth named storm in the season, when it developed Sunday.

It weakened into a tropical depression Monday, but regained tropical storm strength Wednesday.
