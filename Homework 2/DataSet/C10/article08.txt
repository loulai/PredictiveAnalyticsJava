 MIAMI (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Irene reformed in the Atlantic and could eventually become a hurricane, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Thursday.

The center said the chances of the 9th tropical storm of an unusually busy Atlantic hurricane season striking the United States remained uncertain, but Irene appeared to be on a course that could take it to North Carolina or South Carolina.

At 5 a.m. EDT (0900 GMT), Irene was 695 miles south-southeast of Bermuda and moving west-northwest at 14 mph (22 kph).

Maximum sustained winds were at 40 mph (65 kph) and some strengthening was expected over the next 24 hours.

Irene first formed into a tropical storm last Sunday to the east-northeast of the Leeward Islands of the Caribbean, but then faded.

The 2005 hurricane season has been the busiest on record so far, with nine tropical storms, and the worst months are still to come. Most storms form between late August and early October, with the peak of the season in early September.

An average season has 10 storms, with six growing to hurricane strength and two becoming major hurricanes with sustained winds over 111 mph (178 kph).

The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted this season would bring 18 to 21 storms, including nine to 11 hurricanes and five to seven major hurricanes.

Last year saw 15 storms, which spawned nine hurricanes, four of which slammed into Florida in a six-week period, causing billions of dollars in damages.
