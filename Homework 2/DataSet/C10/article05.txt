MIAMI — Tropical Storm Irene continued to strengthen today as it approached the East Coast, but its threat to land remained uncertain, forecasters said.

The five-day forecast from the National Hurricane Center indicated that Irene could near the coastline between North Carolina and Massachusetts, or curve out to sea.

At 10 a.m. CDT, Irene's top sustained winds had increased to about 65 mph — 9 mph shy of hurricane status. A hurricane-hunter plane was scheduled to fly into the storm later today to get a better reading on its strength.

Irene's center was about 300 miles south-southwest of Bermuda and 700 miles southeast of Cape Hatteras, N.C. It was moving northwest near 13 mph, though it was expected to slow down, forecasters said.

Irene became the earliest ninth named storm in the season, when it developed Sunday. Normally, there are only two named storms by this time in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June to November.

The storm weakened into a tropical depression Monday, but regained tropical storm strength Wednesday.
