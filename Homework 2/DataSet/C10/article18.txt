MIAMI, Florida (AP) -- Tropical Storm Irene keeps getting stronger.

Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Miami say it could reach hurricane strength as it approaches the US East Coast, but they say Irene's threat to land is still uncertain.

A five-day forecast indicates that Irene could near the US coastline somewhere from North Carolina to Massachusetts, but could also curve out to sea.

At 11:00 am, Irene's top sustained winds had increased to about 65 miles-an-hour. Hurricanes sustain winds of at least 74 miles-an-hour. A hurricane hunter aircraft will be flying into the storm later today to get a better reading on its strength.

Irene's center was located about 300 miles south-southwest of Bermuda and about 700 miles southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. It's moving northwest near 13 miles-an-hour, though it's expected to slow down.
