MIAMI (AP) - Tropical depression Irene continued to become better organized as it moved closer to the East Coast on Wednesday, raising the possibility it could eventually hit the United States as a hurricane, forecasters said.

Irene had top sustained winds near 35 mph, 5 mph higher than earlier in the day, and could regain tropical storm status by later Wednesday or by Thursday. Tropical storms have sustained winds of at least 39 mph.

At 5 p.m. EDT, Irene was about 750 miles south-southeast of Bermuda, forecasters said. It was moving west at about 13 mph and was expected to continue over the next five days in the general direction of the U.S. coastline from Florida to the Carolinas, according to National Hurricane Center in Miami.

Jennifer Pralgo, a hurricane center meteorologist, said it is possible that Irene could reach hurricane strength winds of 74 mph because it will be passing over warmer waters.

Irene became a tropical storm Sunday, breaking records as the earliest ninth named storm in the Atlantic hurricane season, which began June 1 and ends Nov. 30. Normally, there are only two named storms by this time in the season.

Irene weakened into a tropical depression Monday.
