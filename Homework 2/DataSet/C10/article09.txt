Tropical Storm Irene, which was upgraded from a depression late yesterday, is expected to strengthen as it follows a path that may take it toward the U.S. East Coast, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami.

Irene was about 605 miles (975 kilometers) south-southeast of Bermuda at 5 a.m. local time, according to an advisory on the center's Web site. With maximum sustained winds of about 40 miles per hour, the storm was moving west-northward at 14 mph.

A five-day prediction shows Irene moving west-northwest, passing between the Bahamas and Bermuda on Aug. 13 and Aug 14, before approaching the U.S. coast somewhere between Delaware and South Carolina early on Aug. 16.

Irene is the ninth named storm of this year's Atlantic hurricane season, the busiest on record. U.S. forecasters last week said the season will be worse than previously predicted, producing as many as 21 tropical storms, 11 of which may become hurricanes. That compares with a forecast in May that predicted 12 to 15 named storms and seven to nine hurricanes.

Storms are named when sustained winds reach 39 mph. A hurricane is a storm with sustained winds of least 74 mph.

Dennis and Emily, the fourth and fifth named storms of the June 1-Nov. 30 season, in July cut a swathe through the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, forcing evacuations from homes and oil facilities, and causing almost $2 billion in damage.
