Police Seize 800 Kilograms of Amphetamine in Raid

Taipei, Oct. 8 (CNA) -- Police seized a record 800 
kilograms of amphetamine in a raid Wednesday afternoon. 
Police estimate that the amphetamine, in liquid form, was the largest seizure of 
the illegal substance ever by law enforcement authorities in Taiwan. It was 
estimated to have a street value of at least NT$300 [new Taiwan dollars] million 
(US$10.45 million). 

Police detained Yeh Tsou-fa in connection with the case and are still tracking 
other two suspects who remain on the run. 
An initial investigation found that Yeh had opened a button-making factory in 
Chunan township in Miaoli County, northern Taiwan, as a cover for his illegal 
operation. He had stored the 800 kilograms of amphetamine in 10 large barrels 
and admitted to distributing the drug throughout the northern part of the island 
in plastic bottles. 

Yeh said that with the price of the drug rising recently, he had sought to 
produce the substance himself along with other friends for the large profits to 
be made. 

He denied that the liquefied amphetamine seized by police was smuggled from the 
mainland. The authorities said that they are trying to verify his story. 
Police officers were tipped recently that drug traffickers had set up an 
amphetamine plant in Chunan, which culminated in Wednesday's swoop on the plant. 
During the raid, they also seized filtering equipment used in producing 
amphetamine and two remodeled toy guns.
