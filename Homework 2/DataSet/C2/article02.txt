Taipei Police Seize 34 Kg of Amphetamines

Taipei, June 8 (CNA) Law enforcement officials from the 
Taipei City Police Bureau, Bureau of Investigation and military police on Sunday 
busted a drug smuggling ring and seized 34 kilograms of amphetamines.
Two suspects, identified as Hsing Chih-chiang and Lee Yao-tsung, were arrested.
On Sunday morning officers swooped down on the residence shared by Hsing and Lee 
in the Taipei suburb of Panchiao and uncovered the amphetamines concealed in a 
container of chopsticks produced in mainland China.
The 34 kg of amphetamines have a street value of more than NT$100 million 
(US$3.6 million) and represent the largest drug seizure so far this year.
Police are now hunting for the ring's two alleged masterminds, Chen Ting-chu and 
Yang Chien-wu. According to investigators, the two are also involved in arms 
smuggling and are now hiding in mainland China.
Authorities began to track Hsing after cracking another drug smuggling case in 
April in which 16 kg of amphetamines were transported to Taiwan from the island 
of Kinmen, located a few kilometers from the mainland Chinese port of Xiamen.
Hsing traveled to mainland China in May, allegedly to meet with Chen and Yang to 
discuss how to ship the 34 kgs of amphetamines to Taiwan.
