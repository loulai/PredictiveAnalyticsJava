Shanghai, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Police in China's largest 
metropolis have cracked the country's first case involving MDMA and MDA, drugs 
in the category of Amphetamines.
In the early morning of February 15, a score of people were found taking the 
drugs in several public places of entertainment, and a man from Hong Kong was 
seized on the spot while selling the drugs, according to Zhang Shenghua, deputy 
director of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau.
More than 120 pills were discovered on the man.
Police sources said MDMA and MDA stimulate the nerve center, and that drug-users 
get excited easily and tend to act violently.
The deputy director said that the city's police would carry out tougher 
crackdowns on the trafficking and use of "narcotic drugs."
