NPC Official Calls For Ocean Protection

Jinan, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Economic development in 
coastal areas should not be achieved at the cost of the ocean environment, and 
the ocean must not be treated as a dumping ground for waste, according to Bai 
Qingcai, a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress 
(NPC). 

Bai is heading an NPC fact-finding team on a nine-day tour of east China's 
Shandong Province to determine the province's success in implementing the Law on 
Protecting the Ocean Environment. 
He encouraged the development of environment-friendly technology-intensive 
industries and called for the strictly controlling and, if need be, closing 
enterprises creating pollution. 

Shandong, which has approximately one sixth of the nation's coastline, initiated 
extensive development of coastal areas in early 1991 and has since continued 
expanding its marine economy. 

Yet The rapid development of marine-related industries has been accompanied by 
rising pollution. The 20-odd incidents of marine pollution in 1997 alone caused 
direct economic losses of over 20 million yuan (2.4 million US dollars). 
Experts stress that the lack of any sense of urgency for treating ocean 
pollution on the part of some local leaders and the general public, as well as 
the inadequate implementation of related laws on marine pollution are the main 
factors for increased ocean pollution in the province.
