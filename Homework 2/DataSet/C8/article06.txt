CNA: Cga To Step Up Crackdown On Ocean Pollution

       Taipei, Sept. 15 (CNA) -- The Cabinet-level Coast Guard Administration 
(CGA) is stepping up investigations into pollution and littering in Republic of 
China territorial waters and its apprehension of ocean-going vessels that 
violate ROC laws of ocean pollution control.

    The CGA has recently set up an air patrol squad to beef up its inspection 
and investigation into the pollution of ROC waters by discharged oil and other 
waste from shipping in the area, according to CGA officials.

    The waters surrounding Taiwan have long been favored by foreign ships 
wishing to dispose of unwanted oil and other waste, as there were previously no 
precise statutes to govern and deter such behavior.

    Since November 2000, however, when the legislation of the Ocean Pollution 
Control Act was passed and promulgated, the CGA has begun to apprehend 
violators, although the success rate has not been high due to shortages of both 
manpower and facilities.

    The new air patrol squad now conducts night-time patrols, taking pictures of 
ships that are found clandestinely disposing of waste oil into ROC territorial 
waters.

    CGA officials quoted the Ocean Pollution Control Act as indicating that 
apart from waste that is allowed under international law to be released into the 
open seas, all pollutants, including oil, should be stored aboard or released 
into appointed receptacles on land after paying the relevant fees.

    Violators -- passing ships that dump toxins, oil or other waste into ROC 
waters -- now will be taken into custody by Taiwan's harbor authorities for 
investigation, the CGA officials said.
