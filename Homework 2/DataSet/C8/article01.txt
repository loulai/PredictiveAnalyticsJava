Scientists To Cooperate With Russians on Ocean Pollution

Beijing, August 13 (XINHUA) -- Chinese and Russian 
scientists have plans to cooperate in oceanology in order to monitor ocean 
pollution better.
The College of Marine Geosciences of Ocean University of Qingdao, the Institute 
of Hydrogeology and Engineering of the Ministry of Geology and Mineral 
Resources, and Russia's Shirshov Institute of Oceanology plan to work together 
in marine geology and environment research to find effective ways of dealing 
with the ocean pollution problem.
Professors Evgeny Kontar, Yang Zuosheng, and Fei Jin have met with each other to 
discuss possible co-operation during the on-going 30th International Geological 
Congress.
They say they believe that co-operation would be a good beginning for 
Sino-Russian scientific communication on oceanography.
Professor Kontar said that ocean pollution is a global problem, but that he has 
complete confidence in the success of the co-operation.
