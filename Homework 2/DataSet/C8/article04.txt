National Survey Indicates Ocean Pollution in China Worsening

    Qingdao, July 31   (XINHUA)   -- China's offshore areas are continuing to 
get worse, according to a national survey.   

    Wang Shuguang, director of the State Oceanic Administration, said at a forum 
on oceanic science-technology and economic development today that pollution in 
China's offshore areas is worsening.   

    Most of the river estuaries, bays and sea areas near big and medium-sized 
cities have been seriously polluted.   

    The survey began in 1997, aiming to gather information regarding China's 
offshore area at the end of the 20th century.   

    Wang Shuguang said sea areas 10 to 30 kilometers from the coast, and even as 
far out as 120 to 200 kilometers from the coast have been polluted.   The major 
pollutants are azote, phosphor, oil, organic substances, and heavy metals such 
as lead and mercury.   

    Deposits at some river estuaries and bays have been seriously polluted by 
organic substances, organic salt, heavy metals and organic chlorine compounds.   


    Wang pointed out that organic salt and organic substances in China's 
offshore areas have worsened since the 1990s, and more than 200 red tides were 
reported in the past decade, including 45 serious ones.   

    "Ocean pollution has caused serious economic losses," the official said.
