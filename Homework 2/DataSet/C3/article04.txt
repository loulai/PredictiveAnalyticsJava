Russian Daily: US Spy Plane Crisis To Be Resolved Only After Jiang Return

The sister of Kenneth Richter, one of the crew members of the U.S. spy plane 
that was intercepted by Chinese fighters, like all the relatives of the other 
captives, is hoping for the swift return home of her brother.  In accordance 
with an old tradition, she has tied a yellow ribbon round an elm tree [as 
published] on a California hill.  But it looks like she will have a long wait.

   Informed sources in Beijing stated to ITAR-TASS that the issue of the return 
of the U.S. spy plane and its crew will be resolved after PRC President Jiang 
Zemin returns from his tour of Latin American countries.

   At present the Chinese head of state is on an official visit to Argentina.  
His Latin American tour covering six countries -- Brazil, the Argentine, Chile, 
Venezuela, Uruguay, and Cuba -- will end 17 April.

   According to the sources, "a positive resolution of the issue for Washington 
can only come after the US administration has apologized officially to Beijing." 
 Otherwise the crew and plane may "remain a long time" in China.
