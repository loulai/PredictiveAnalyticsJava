North Korea: What would happen if Kim Jong-un ordered nuclear explosion in Pacific
The country's foreign minister says leader Kim Jong-un is considering powerful blast following 'rocket man' jibe from Donald Trump
North Korea may be planning one of the most powerful nuclear explosions in history, if the nation's foreign minister is to be believed.

Ri Yong-ho, the foreign minister of the isolated nation, reportedly told journalists that the nation's leader Kim Jong-un is considering such a test blast.

“It could be the most powerful detonation of an H-bomb in the Pacific,” Mr Ri told reporters at the United Nations in New York on Thursday, according to a story by South Korea's Yonhap News Agency.

“We have no idea about what actions could be taken as it will be ordered by leader Kim Jong Un.”
In a speech before the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, Mr Trump called Mr Kim a suicidal “rocket man” and threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea if the US is “forced to defend itself or its allies.”

Mr Kim allegedly responded with a written statement, in which he called Mr Trump a “mentally deranged US dotard” and said that “a frightened dog barks louder.”

Many experts have denounced Mr Trump's speech, suggesting his words could provoke Mr Kim to take dramatic action.

“Trump is basically creating audience costs for Kim to back down,” Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, told Vox. “If you dare Kim, it creates pressure for him to respond with his own provocation.”
