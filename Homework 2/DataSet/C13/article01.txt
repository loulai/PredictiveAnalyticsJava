SEOUL, South Korea — Over the years, as North Korea raced to build a nuclear arsenal, the world has often turned to its neighbors for help: China, because of its economic leverage over the North, and South Korea, because it would suffer the most in any military confrontation.

Now, with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, engaged in a dangerous war of words with President Trump, China and South Korea have been left squirming on the sidelines, with Mr. Kim having been essentially granted his wish: dealing directly with the United States, which Pyongyang believes has the most to give.

To the North Koreans, the United States can offer a peace treaty, diplomatic recognition, the easing of decades-old sanctions and the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea, which Pyongyang considers its existential threat.

Since Mr. Kim came to power nearly six years ago, North Korea has accelerated its nuclear and missile tests to grab Washington’s attention and to force negotiations on terms favorable to Pyongyang, according to South Korean intelligence officials and analysts who study Mr. Kim’s motives.

When Mr. Trump threatened on Tuesday to “totally destroy” North Korea, it gave Mr. Kim a perfect chance to square off directly against the United States, they said. In an unprecedented personal statement on Friday, Mr. Kim called Mr. Trump a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard” and the North Korean foreign minister raised the prospect of exploding a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific.
