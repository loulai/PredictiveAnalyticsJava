VIENNA: The UN nuclear watchdog agency’s 35-nation board adopted a resolution on Thursday expressing ‘serious concern’ over Iran’s resumption of uranium conversion -- a process that some fear could be used to help build a bomb -- and asked it to stop.

The resolution said “outstanding issues relating to Iran’s nuclear programme have yet to be resolved, and that the agency is not yet in a position to conclude that there are no undeclared nuclear materials or activities in Iran." It expressed ‘serious concern’ over the regime’s resumption of uranium conversion at its nuclear facility at Isfahan, saying the move 'underlines the importance of rectifying the situation... and of allowing for the possibility of further discussions in relation to that situation."

The resolution did not mention reporting the regime to the UN Security Council, which
has the power to impose crippling sanctions.

The agency’s board asked IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei to provide it with a comprehensive report on Iran’s compliance with an agency safeguards agreement by September 3.

Iran reacted with indignation to the resolution. 'It is evident that the motive is to apply pressure," said Iran’s chief IAEA delegate, Sirus Nasseri. 'Fortunately, Iran will not bend. Iran will be a nuclear fuel producer and supplier within a decade."

Earlier, EU and its allies asked the UN nuclear watchdog to urge Tehran to halt sensitive atomic work it resumed this week. The draft, drawn up by Britain, Germany and France said Iran must resume a full suspension of all nuclear fuel related activities.
