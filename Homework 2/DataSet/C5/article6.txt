TEHRAN, August 12 (RIA Novosti, Nikolai Terekhov) - Another group of experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has arrived in Iran to inspect nuclear facilities, an Iranian radio station said Friday. The radio station, quoting a source within Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, did not link the arrival of international inspectors with the resumption of the Isfahan nuclear center's operations, saying that the visit was merely "routine." On Thursday, an emergency session of the IAEA Board of Governors passed a resolution demanding that Tehran terminate all nuclear activities, including at Isfahan.

Tehran called the resolution "unacceptable and politicized," and refused to comply. The Iranian authorities said they would continue to develop their nuclear technology. They agreed to negotiate with the "EU Troika" (Britain, France and Germany) only with regards to Natanz uranium enrichment facility in near Tehran, whose operation has not yet been resumed.

The Iranian parliament has not ratified the additional protocol to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) signed by the government of former president Mohammad Khatami, but the document is being observed almost in full, and IAEA specialists have been visiting Iranian nuclear facilities without prior notice, in accordance with the treaty.

Iran has had the largest number of inspections of nuclear facilities of any country over the last two-and-a-half years.

No proof has yet been found of military intent in Iran's nuclear programs, despite accusations from the U.S. and Israel of Iran's plans to create an A-bomb. The European Union recently joined these two countries, speaking of Iran's possible shift of its nuclear program towards military ends.
