MOSCOW (AFX) - Russia called for 'de-escalation' of tensions and for dialogue over Iran's decision to resume nuclear fuel work.

Russia supported yesterday's decision by the UN nuclear watchdog -- the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) -- urging Iran to resume its moratorium on nuclear fuel production, the foreign ministry said in a statement.

'Having supported this resolution, we believe it is essential to create conditions for a de-escalation of the situation and a return to the path of negotiation,' the ministry said.

Dialogue should aim to 'reach a solution that in the end meets Iranian interests,' the ministry said, while boosting trust of Iran's nuclear intentions. 'Russia for its part is ready to use all means to help the development of the situation along this path.'

Iran has flatly rejected the IAEA's resolution, saying it has the right to produce nuclear fuel.
