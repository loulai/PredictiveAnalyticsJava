A third of the way into the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, NOAA looked at the ocean and air temperatures and issued an ominous new forecast: the region would likely experience "an above normal hurricane season" that "could be extremely active," with more named storms than previously expected—14 to 19 this season—and two to five major hurricanes.

Now, halfway through the season, Hurricane Harvey's destruction stretches along the Texas coast, and Hurricane Irma's storm surge has turned coastal Florida streets in saltwater rivers after causing massive destruction in the Caribbean. On Irma's heels, Hurricane Jose is swirling in the Atlantic, while a third Atlantic hurricane, Katia, struck Mexico's eastern coast late Friday night.

As global temperatures continue to rise, climate scientists have said this is what we should expect—more huge storms, with drastic impacts.

Though scientists are still wrestling with some of the specifics of how climate change is impacting hurricanes, a lot is known, including the fact that hurricane seasons like this one could be the new norm.

What's So Extraordinary about These Storms?

Records are tumbling in quick succession this year. Irma, among the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record, barreled over the islands of the Caribbean as a Category 5 storm this week en route to Florida, while Houston, Texas, was still draining from Harvey's five-day deluge that broke the continental U.S. rainfall total for a single event.

Major storms are falling outside their normal range (Irma is the easternmost on record), and at strange times of the year (Tropical Storm Arlene hit in April of this year—one of only two named tropical storms in April, and the northernmost on record for that time of year).
