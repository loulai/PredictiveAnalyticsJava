A letter with a death threat against Prime Minister Ehud 
Baraq was received at the Qiryat Yam mayor's office this morning. The letter, in 
which Baraq is drawn with his eyes covered by swastikas, was signed by members 
of the Satanic cult. Our correspondent 'Itay Rappaport reports that it says: 
Baraq deserves a bullet in the head; he should be taken out. 
Our correspondent notes that last week, hate slogans were painted on the walls 
of a Qiryat Yam school.
