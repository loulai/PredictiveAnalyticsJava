Satanic Cult Followers Labeled `Deranged'

Cairo, Jan 27 (MENA)--Grand Imam of al-Azhar Shaykh 
Sayyid Tantawi said the members of the satanic cult are a group of deranged 
youth, who contracted the infection from abroad.
It is so sad that these young people belong to the high class but it is clear 
that their parents left them without any care and they are to blame for this, 
Shaykh Tantawi added at a meeting here last night.
He added that these youths cannot be described as members of any revealed 
religion since they showed contempt to these religions.
Parents should instill in their children the religious, moral and social values, 
he stressed.
