Russian Interior Ministry plans to step up campaign against Satanic cults

  Moscow, 4 February: The Russian Interior Ministry is concerned about the 
expansion of activities of Satanic sects. 
  Aleksandr Grichanin, deputy chief of a department in the main criminal 
investigation directorate in the Russian Interior Ministry, said this on Tuesday 
[4 February], a RIA-Novosti correspondent reports. 

  Investigations into the activities of Satanic sects fall under the competence 
of the department for the fight against extremism. 
  According to Grichanin, Satanists frequently carry out ritual sacrifices. 
Therefore, in a number of cases their activities are connected with carrying out 
particularly severe crimes, in particular, killings and causing serious bodily 
harm. 

  According to Interior Ministry data, there are several thousand participants 
in Satanic sects in Russia, about 500 in Moscow and as many in St Petersburg, 
and also in the order of 100 in major regional centres of the country. 
  Unfortunately, Grichanin said, in the main it is teenagers aged 13-17, drawn 
by the attributes and rituals of the Satanists, who are members of the sects. 
  The Russian Interior Ministry is planning to step up the fight against 
stopping the activities of such sects, assured Grichanin.
