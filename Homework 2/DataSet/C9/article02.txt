Mufti Blasts Satanic Cult

Cairo, Jan 25 (MENA)--Egypt's mufti, head of the 
religious opinion-giving authority, said the so-called 'Satanic Cult' is built 
on subversive concepts that have no origin in any legislation or revealed 
religion. Egyptians vehemently reject these concepts, Shaykh Nasr Farid Wasil 
told 'Good Morning Egypt' television programme today.
A country without religion cannot survive, he stressed, noting that the members 
of this odd group suffer from a cultural and intellectual vacuum. Such groups 
are intended to mislead the youth and destroy their minds, the highest Islamic 
religious authority in Egypt said.
These young people fell an easy prey to the devil due to their poor faith, he 
said, voicing appreciation to the security agencies for busting this deranged 
group. He termed the rites of the 'Satan Cult' as an index of backwardness, 
blaming their families for failing to protect their children.
