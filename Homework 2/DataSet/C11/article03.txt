Caribbean Leaders To Eye Aid to Montserrat Volcano Victims

The leaders of the Caribbean Community are expected to 
discuss the crisis in Montserrat today, as they begin day three of their 
five-day summit. They have already expressed their willingness to assist the 
country in whatever way possible. Antigua and Barbuda's prime minister, Lester 
Bird, has promised to throw open his country's doors to the people of 
Montserrat, threatened by a rumbling volcano. Rescue workers were still 
searching yesterday for 24 people believed to be still missing following last 
Wednesday's eruption of the Soufriere Hills volcano. A government spokesman says 
there is little hope now of finding them alive.
