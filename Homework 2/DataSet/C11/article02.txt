Kamchatka Volcano Erupts Again 5 Dec

PETROPAVLOVSK-KAMCHATSKIY December 5 (Itar-Tass) -- The 
Bezymyannyy volcano in Kamchatka began erupting for the second time this year on 
Friday morning. 
Volcanologists told Tass that the column of ashes had initially raised to the 
altitude of four kilometres and that eruption increased by noon and ashes rose 
to 8-9 kilometres above the ground. 
Visually, the train of ashes is 20 kilometres long and is moving to the 
north-east in the direction of the Pacific ocean. However, according to the 
information from US satellites, the train of ashes is 100 kilometres long. The 
satellites registered a heat spot over the volcano on Thursday, however ground 
services showed no seismic fluctuations signalling an upcoming eruption. 
A spokesman of the Russian-US scientific group, who monitors the level of danger 
posed for air flights, told Tass that US airlines had been timely informed of 
the eruption and had changed the flight schedule. 
Bezymyannyy is one of the most active volcanoes in Kamchatka. The latest most 
powerful eruption was registered in 1956. The volcano is 2,869 metres high and 
is situated 50 kilometres to the south of the town of Klyuchi. The latest 
eruption occurred this May.
