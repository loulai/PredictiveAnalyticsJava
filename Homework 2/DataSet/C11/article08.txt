Sino-U.S. Spaceborne Imaging Radar Experiment Detects Western Kunlun Volcano Group

The Western Kunlun Mountains are located in the cross-connecting 
zone between the Tarim Plate and the Qing-Zang [i.e. Qinghai-Tibetan] Plateau. 
Since the Cenozoic Era, the volcanic activity in this region has been of great 
significance. Over the past few years, the CAS Institute of Remote Sensing 
Applications [IRSA] has participated in a major international radar 
Earth-observation program. During this program, for example, the Space Shuttle 
Endeavor's imaging-radar remote sensing system [i.e. the SIR-C/X-SAR (see 
FBIS-CST-96-002, 12 Feb 96 pp 17-29)--FBIS] captured multiband, 
multipolarization data from this region. Based on this earlier experiment [in 
April 1994], Endeavor conducted a series of studies and field on-the-spot 
investigations of a volcano group located on the northeast shore of Aksay Lake 
[Aksayqin Hu], over 5400 meters above sea level. Before this, Chinese scientists 
conducted numerous studies of the volcanoes in the northern Qing-Zang Plateau. 
Using advanced imaging-radar data [obtained with the Endeavor system], IRSA 
researchers discovered that this volcano group altogether has a total of nine 
craters, of which No. 1 (center at 80°11' E longitude, 35°30' N latitude) is the 
largest, covering 4 sq km. The IRSA researchers also obtained data on the K-Ar 
and Rb-Sr isotopes in the rocks of this region.
