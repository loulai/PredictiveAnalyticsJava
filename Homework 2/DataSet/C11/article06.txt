Santitation Problems Develop Among Volcano Evacuees

Plymouth, Montserrat, Aug 9, CANA -- Alcohol consumption 
-- even in churches -- and waste disposal have surfaced as problems among 
persons evacuated from Eastern Montserrat, where a volcano is acting up.
At least one minister of religion complained that people were seen consuming 
alcohol on the altar of a church being used as a refugee shelter. Chief Minister 
Reuben Meade, reacting to the complaints of alcohol use among the evacuees, said 
that liquor was not to be consumed on the premises.
The government of this British dependency on Monday issued evacuation orders for 
eastern areas likely to be threatened as a volcano spewed more ash and steam. 
Most of the evacuees are living in churches, schools and tents in northern 
Montserrat, while others are staying with friends or relatives. There have also 
been complaints of littering and disposal of other waste at the emergency 
shelters.

The Chief Minister, in one of his regular updates on the situation here, urged 
evacuees to improve their sanitation habits and ensure that they do not create 
health problems. The authorities have also been urging people leaving home to 
walk with their own food and medication, to avoid the government having to draw 
heavily on stocks being provided by the British government at such an early 
stage.

There have also been concerns about damage to crops in the area near the 
volcano, caused by roaming livestock. Farmers complained that some villagers had 
released their livestock before heading for the shelters, responding to what 
they said were suggestions by agricultural officials. But the government advised 
evacuees to keep their livestock tethered.
Vehicle owners queued at petrol stations to fill up after the volcanic activity 
increased over the weekend but the panic buying and volcanic activity have 
abated.
