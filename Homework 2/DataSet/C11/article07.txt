Initial Report on Volcano Erupting Inaccurate

PETROPAVLOVSK-KAMCHATSKY, October 14 (Itar-Tass) -- The 
eruption of Kronotskaya Sopka volcano on the Kamchatka peninsula reported on 
Sunday, probably have not taken place. No reports about the volcano eruption 
except for that of the commander of the Zhupanovo frontier guards post have been 
registered, Itar-Tass learnt on Monday from the Kamchatka centre of monitoring 
volcano and seismic activity. It is believed that frontier guards may have 
mistaken for the eruption of Kronotskaya Sopka vocano the heightened activity of 
another volcano, Karymski, said Doctor of Geology and Mineralogy Stanislav 
Balesta, the director of the centre.

Karymski volcano whose latest eruption occurred on January 1, 1996, became more 
active on Sunday, according to a report of a group of observers. Clots of 
smolten lava burst out of the crater to an altitude of upto 500 metres, a 
smokestack rose to five kilometres and stretched toward the Pacific. Karymski 
volcano is situated about 30 kilometres away from the frontier guards post, 
while Kronotskaya Sopka is at a distance of some 100 kilometres. Quite possibly, 
frontier guards mistook the heightened activity of one volcano for the eruption 
of another.
The situation must be cleared today, the director of the monitoring centre told 
Itar-Tass.
