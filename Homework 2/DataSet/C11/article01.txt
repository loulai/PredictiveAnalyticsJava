Hudson Volcano Activity Worries Southern Region Dwellers

Santiago de Chile, 17 Mar (EFE) -- Earth tremors, 
fumaroles, underground noises, ashes, and solfataras from the Hudson Volcano, 
one of the most active volcanoes in South America, worry the inhabitants of 
Chile's southern region of Aysen.
Gustavo Villarroel, Interior Ministry National Emergency Office (ONEMI) regional 
director, noted on 17 March that these phenomena are part of the post-eruptive 
process of this volcano, which produced a strong eruption in 1991.
Villarroel admitted, however, that as these phenomena have occurred together, 
the snow-clad volcano -- some 2,000 km south of Santiago -- is being closely 
monitored.

He indicated that the phenomena were reported over local radio stations. He said 
that seismographic measurements have been implemented in that area since 
February, and that seismographic measurements that will be taken throughout the 
year.

The ONEMI expert asked the population to remain calm. He gave assurances that 
the authorities are ready for any emergency situation. [passage omitted on
