MOSCOW, November 18 (Itar-Tass) -- Moscow is seriously concerned over 
conflicting reports from Pyongyang about North Korea's "right to have nuclear 
capability," Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Yakovenko told Tass 
Monday.
  "Russia expects friendly North Korean leadership to strictly comply with all 
provisions and commitments the fundamental nuclear arms non-proliferation treaty 
implies," the diplomat said.
  He described the non-proliferation treaty as a "prerequisite of global 
strategic stability and peace and security in the Korean peninsula."
